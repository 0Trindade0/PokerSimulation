Card Game Simulator

Overview

This is a simple Python project designed for studying Python programming, particularly focusing on working with lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions. The program simulates a card game where players receive a specific number of cards based on the selected game.

Features

Allows the user to choose between Poker, Blackjack, or Truco.

Supports 2 to 16 players.

Uses a standard 52-card deck.

Shuffles and distributes cards randomly to players.

Evaluates the best poker hand from the given cards.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas (for handling the card deck data)

How to Run the Program

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the required library by running:

pip install pandas

Run the script:

python card_game.py
